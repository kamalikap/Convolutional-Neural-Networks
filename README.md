# Convolutional-Neural-Networks

* Initialized the layer using Sequential function, added two convolutional, two max pooling layer(for better accuracy), flattening layer and one fully connected layer. 
* Compiled the classifier using 'Adam' optimizer. Rescaled the images using ImageGenerator. 
* Trained the model starting with 25 epochs(accuracy- 99.78%, validation accuracy- 80.19%) and then to 100 epochs(accuracy- 94.76%, validation accuracy- 90.30%).
* Predicted the test image and classified into cat or dog.
